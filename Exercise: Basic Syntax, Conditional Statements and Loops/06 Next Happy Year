You&#39;re saying good-bye your best friend, &quot;See you next happy year&quot;. Happy Year is the year with only distinct digits,
(e.g) 2018. Write a program that receives an integer number and finds the next happy year.

year = int(input())

while True:
    year += 1
    if len(str(year)) == len(set(str(year))):
        print(year)
        break
        
        the int needs to be converted to a str, as this is how the possitions can be counted
        len - gives the total number of elements
        set - eliminates the repeating elements of the string
